Student{ 
 int rollno;
 String sname, classname;

e) Print detail of all students on the basis of Name 
8) Consider following class :- class ProductionFacility {
int pliid; 
String pro_facility_name;
String pro_fa_location;
int totalproduction_perday;
String itemnames[];
LocalDate prod_date;
}
You have to perform following task.
a) Print the details of facility with highest production per day. (you have to 
add at least 3 days details of each facility after that you have to calculate 
average of 3 days on the basis of average you have to print the facility with
